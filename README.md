# CS 3240 Team B-24 Geo-guessing App
We developed a competitive forum for users to guess locations posted by other users around UVA grounds with limited information, with an active points leaderboard. The game uses a daily challenge structure, where users are presented with one location to guess per day. However, former day's challenges appear as well to ensure all users can complete all of the challenges!
